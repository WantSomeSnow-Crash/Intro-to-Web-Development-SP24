I thought the article was very interesting. I took a prototyping and ideation class last semester and it mainly focused on the ideas that were mentioned in the article. In my opition I think it is most important to know your audience as those are the indivuals who will be using the product, and how it says in the article, "It's easy to make a simple mistake of designing for the wrong audience. I think that is where the clarifying of the problem comes into play as well because those are key questions that will help lead to the early development of the product. that the article was very helpful in the sense that it gave a lot of examples of how to go about the process of designing a product that will be the backbone of the final product.
